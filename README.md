# HackProof
UOfT Hacks 2016 Submission

HackProof is a service that aims to eliminate cheaters in the hacking community. We detect when a hackathon project submission is similar to one that was submitted in the past so judges can make accurate judgments. 

We dreamt of a service that would be used by all hackathon organizers for submissions and would completely eliminate people who reuse project ideas to win multiple hackathons or copy previous winner's ideas to get easy recognition. 

Currently our system has a limited user interface we would like to improve it to have an easily searchable front page to view all project submissions and organize them based on each hackathon. Another limitation is the database size, because we havn't harvested any previous projects, this app would only be useful for projects produced after the release. 

We plan to improve HackProof by making the user interface more user friendly and improving the algorithm that predicts how similar one program is to another.
